Just a quick update from me before a proper post during the upcoming weekend.  I've been a Spotify user for quite some time now, and have been building up a collection of playlists.  As I don't really have many avenues for sharing this kind of content, I thought I'd share it on here.

## Siren Sessions 8

So here we are, introducing Siren Sessions.  This is episode 8, so I've already done 7 (obviously) so far.  The premise of the series is to gather a collection (roughly 20 tracks) of female vocal music that I like.  It's as simple as that.  By the magic of HTML, an embedded player should appear below.

Add me up on Spotify, and let me know what you think here.  I will be posting all future updates here too.
