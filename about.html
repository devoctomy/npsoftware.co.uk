<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Nick Pateman and live on the south coast of Blighty and I work as
a software engineer for tax services.  I was first exposed to programming
when I was roughly 4 years old, I would watch my mother type basic games out
on a Dragon32 from a book.  Back then you could actually buy books with source
code in, crazy, but I was fascinated how typing this weird language onto the
computer could make things.  My mother let me help at times, and as I got older
I started fiddling with parts of the code to see what would happen.<p>

<p>Fast forward 35 years later and here I am, still just as fascinated with code
but with a much greater level of understanding (well I like to think that's the
case anyway).  I've worked in a few areas of IT, from control systems automation,
to content protection with media synchronisation, all the way to IT security
via cloud distributed 2-factor authentication.  In each of those areas, the types
of solutions I have had to create and be part of, have covered a huge area of
computing.  And the crazy thing is, I still haven't scratched the surface.</p>

<p>It's not all work work work though, occasionally I do have fun, actually I
try and fun as much as possible.  I love taking photographs, listening to music,
reading, watching films, creating things (not always using a computer, but mostly)
and knocking back a glass of wine or two.</p>
