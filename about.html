<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Nick Pateman and live on the south coast of Blighty, in a rather
windy town.  Not much happens around here, that's why I work in London, near
"Tech Roundabout", Shoreditch.  My main past time involves pretty much anything
related to technology, mainly programming.  I was first exposed to programming
when I was roughly 4 years old, I would watch my mother type basic games out
on a Dragon32 from a book.  Back then you could actually buy books with source
code in, crazy, but I was fascinated how typing this weird language onto the
computer could make things.  My mother let me help at times, and as I got older
I started fiddling with parts of the code to see what would happen.<p>

<p>Fast forward 21 years later and here I am, still just as fascinated with code
but with a much greater level of understanding (well I like to think that's the
case anyway).  I've worked in a few areas of IT, from control systems automation,
to content protection with media synchronisation, all the way to IT security
via cloud distributed 2-factor authentication.  In each of those areas, the types
of solutions I have had to create and be part of, have covered a huge area of
computing.  And the crazy thing is, I still haven't scratched the surface.</p>

<p>It's not all work work work though, occasionally I do have fun, actually I
try and fun as much as possible.  I love taking photographs, listening to music,
reading, watching films, creating things (not always using a computer, but mostly)
and knocking back a glass of wine or two.</p>

<p>I used to do a bit of DJ'ing, and had my own monthly house/trance show on
<a href="http://www.ah.fm">AfterHours.fm</a>.  I went under the name of DJ-Abstraction,
I don't expect anyone to know that name lol, it was fun for a while, but also
hard work spending about £30 - £40 on music every month and many hours trying to
lay down the perfect mix, not to mention how expensive the equipment was.
Anyway, it soon became more of a chore than a past time, so I left it behind.
Maybe one day I will pick it back up again, who knows.  Anyway, I still have all my
old shows uploaded on my Amazon S3 account, you can download them

like that kind of thing.</p>
