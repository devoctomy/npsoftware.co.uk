<p>So I spent last Sunday working on deploying another Jekyll site, using a different theme this time which actually tought me a hell of a lot about the differences with themes.  I would recommend taking a deep dive into several themes before finally deciding on one, so much so that I‚Äôm actually considering changing this site to something with more features.  I might not though, seeing as it‚Äôs taken me a whole weekend sorting these two out as it is and I have another 2 yet to complete.</p>

<p>You can check out my mums new site at the following URL, (not totally finished and my mum is still adding content)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.knittedbysteph.com">www.knittedbysteph.com</a></p>

<p>And yup, just incase you didn‚Äôt read that correctly, my mum is now authoring her site using GitHub &amp; Markdown, ‚Äòcos that‚Äôs just how she rolls! She‚Äôs using <a href="http://atom.io">ATOM</a> as her Markdown editor.</p>

<h2 id="not-all-templates-are-created-equal">Not All Templates Are Created Equal</h2>

<p>As you would expect, there can be a huge difference in usability between site templates, but not only that, some really handy features too, like my mums new site, allows you to configure multiple authors.  This simple ability allows you to create guest blog posts much easier than the template I‚Äôm currently using.</p>

<p>The template I chose for knittedbysteph.com is the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/">So Simple Theme</a>.  I removed what was the ‚ÄòBlog‚Äô section of the theme and repurposed the ‚ÄòArticles‚Äô section as this provides pretty much the same functionality, only with guest author support, great!  This theme also has a whole host of additional social networking integration options that aren‚Äôt available on mine, although they aren‚Äôt all essential for my purposes, they are nice to have.</p>

<h2 id="other-lessons-learned">Other Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Aside from templating lessons, I have also learnt quite a bit about Amazon CloudFront, which I‚Äôm using to globally distribute the site so that it‚Äôs super fast, no matter where in the world it‚Äôs being loaded from, and still many times cheaper than hosting a CMS on Azure.  The main lesson is caching time, this <em>will</em> do your head in, honestly.  Changes are not instantaneous as you can imagine, considering the site has to be duplicated all over the globe, the data is ‚Äúeventually consistent‚Äù.  I found myself changing some graphics, and struggling to get the changes to be shown in the browser, even at the original bucket URL.  I found a combination of deleting my source buckets content, and recreating it, as well as making an invalidation set (I think that‚Äôs what they call it) in CloudFront of /*  Now I‚Äôm not entirely sure what works best, but I also dropped the TTL to 1 hour, from 24 hours.  Eventually the changes show up, so this can be a bit frustrating which is why it‚Äôs best to test as much locally as possible, prior to pushing live, or use a staging bucket that isn‚Äôt using CloudFront.</p>

<p>I also found that on a number of occasions my markdown wasn‚Äôt rendered correctly, for example my first blog post appeared as just one solid h2 block, not good!  Pushing the source to git again seemed to resolve this.  Not sure how this could happen in all honesty, I‚Äôm hoping it was a one-off.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs Next?</h2>

<p>Well the next website I have to do is going to be quite a bit more tricky, it‚Äôs for my photography blog ‚Äòhdrzone.co.uk‚Äô.  I‚Äôm really wanting something impressive with this and am pretty sure using Jekyll and S3 will give me just what I‚Äôm after.  I‚Äôve already picked the theme, which is the  <a href="http://www.hossainmohdfaysal.com/hmfaysal-omega-theme/">Hmfaysal Omega Theme</a> as this has some nice photo gallery support.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm hoping to have it up and running this weekend, so fingers crossed!  Anyway, just a side note, I still think the whole GitHub / Jekyll / Travis-CI approach to site building is the way to go for now, even with the little oddities here and there it‚Äôs still more reliable than using a CMS.</p>
