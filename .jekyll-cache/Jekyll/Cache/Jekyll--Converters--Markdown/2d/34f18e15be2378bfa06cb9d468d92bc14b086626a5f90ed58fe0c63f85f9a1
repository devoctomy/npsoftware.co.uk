I"Ä<p>Just a quick update from me before a proper post during the upcoming weekend.  Iâ€™ve been a Spotify user for quite some time now, and have been building up a collection of playlists.  As I donâ€™t really have many avenues for sharing this kind of content, I thought Iâ€™d share it on here.</p>

<h2 id="siren-sessions-8">Siren Sessions 8</h2>

<p>So here we are, introducing Siren Sessions.  This is episode 8, so Iâ€™ve already done 7 (obviously) so far.  The premise of the series is to gather a collection (roughly 20 tracks) of female vocal music that I like.  Itâ€™s as simple as that.  By the magic of HTML, an embedded player should appear below.</p>

<p>Follow me up on Spotify (button below), and let me know what you think here.  I will be posting all future updates here too.</p>
